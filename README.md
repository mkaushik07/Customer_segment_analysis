Customer Segment Analysis
Overview
This project aims to perform in-depth customer segmentation using Agglomerative Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By analyzing customer data based on income and spending patterns, this project identifies distinct customer segments to help in targeted marketing and strategic decision-making.

Features
Customer Segmentation: Utilizes Agglomerative Clustering to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their financial and spending behaviors.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applies PCA to simplify the dataset while retaining essential variance, enhancing the clustering process.
Visualization: Provides clear and informative visualizations of customer segments and their characteristics.
Data Exploration: Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and patterns before clustering.

Methodology
Data Collection: Acquires customer data, including income and spending patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data, handling missing values and normalizing features.
Dimensionality Reduction: Uses PCA to reduce the number of dimensions while retaining 85% of the variance in the dataset.
Segmentation: Applies Agglomerative Clustering to group customers into four distinct segments based on their income and spending patterns.
Analysis: Interprets and visualizes the results to identify key characteristics of each segment.
Reporting: Provides actionable insights for marketing strategies and customer engagement.

Results
The project successfully identified four distinct customer segments, providing valuable insights into customer behavior. The clustering results and visualizations can be used to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
